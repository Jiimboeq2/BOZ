Spell Queues are for crafting experts (down the line i'll add the GMs once books are actually out)

IC is for instance controller zones


other than that the main folder should be cast stacks/ AA's


Move the scripts to C:\Program Files (x86)\InnerSpace\Scripts.

Move the profiles to C:\Program Files (x86)\InnerSpace\Scripts\EQ2OgreBot\Save and rename it as your own toon name ( be sure to delete your old stack/ BACK IT UP if you'd like

OR

C:\Program Files (x86)\InnerSpace\Scripts\EQ2OgreBot\Save\ProfilesToImport   > check admin tab (refresh first) search for it in that tab and hit load , then should be in your drop down

For Temp Adorns, go to C:\Program Files (x86)\InnerSpace\Scripts\EQ2OgreCommon\OgreTempAdorns.
